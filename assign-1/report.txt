Hi,

There are a few things to note

[A] The assignment listed the following
....
Write a java program that will:
â€¢	Accept three input arguments: 
1.	input file name
2.	output folder path
3.	numeric argument (query id), range limited from 1 to 2.
...

The submitted assignment expects an input folder and looks for a hardcoded file name
in the specified folder

[B] The main function is written as follows:

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

/**/
new App("WhiteHouse-WAVES-2012.csv", "./", 1);
//new App("WhiteHouse-WAVES-2012.csv", "./", 2);
//new App("WhiteHouse-WAVES-2012.csv", "./", 3);
/*/							<--- you have a missing * here, else all would have worked fine !!!
if(args.length < 3){
System.out.printf("Usage: ./run.sh <input file> <output folder> <query number>%n");
}else{
new App(args[0], args[1], Integer.valueOf(args[2]));
}
/**/

System.out.println("exiting ...");
}

This means that the command line arguments are ignored and there is no way for the
query 2 could be executed. Also, even if the command line arguments were being
parsed, the commented code will prevent the code from ever being executed.

[C] Problem [A] occurs because of problem B.

Considering it is an oversight and the code works correctly if the missing '*' is corrected,
the assignment would get 

[D] The output format for query 1 was
o	Write the NameFirst, NameLast, Number of Visits to a tab-separated file named query_results_1.tsv in the output folder path
the submitted code reverses the order and prints lastname, firstname, number of visits

GRADE: 46 marks out of 50

-1 for breaking compatibility with the test script
-1 for making instructor make the code changes
-2 for reversing the order of the o/p fields

For doing the stretch problems, I would assign you 10 marks for extra cretit

*****
Your total credit for this assignment would be 56, although I would expect more due diligence hence forth.
